Pravin Adithya Srinivasan: He worked majorly on the dijkstras file and helped on with the generate map. 
Manihams Suraparaju: I worked on the generate_map and shellscript to record the elapsed time and memory usage in a Markdown table. I also helped with the logic for dijkstras file.

Questions:

1. The graph is represented as a 2D grid with each tile functions as a graph node and edges exist between adjacent tiles. The adjacency follows four directions- up, down, left, and right. The edges have weights with the cost of leaving a tile rather than entering it.
2. Our implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm has a time complexity of O((V + E) * log(V)). We used a priority queue that organized nodes by their cost, allowing efficient selection of the next lowest-cost node. Additionally, we utilized 2D vectors and an unordered map to store and access cells efficiently, enabling fast lookups during pathfinding.
3. The implementation scale was very low for the small map sizes and for large maps, both the execution and memory usage increased quadratically. The execution time increases with N^2 log N as the size of the map increases.
